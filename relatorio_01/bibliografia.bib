abstract = {A temporal approximate deconvolution model (TADM) is developed for large-eddy simulation and is demonstrated for plane-channel flow at Re-tau=590. The TADM combines explicit causal time-domain filtering with linear deconvolution (defiltering) to approximate unfiltered fields and residual stress to arbitrarily high order. The TADM methodology appears to lead to a robust family of residual-stress models that should provide a viable alternative to conventional (spatial) filtering for applications in which spatial filtering is problematic, e.g., for problems requiring unstructured or highly stretched grids.

The main ingredient is an approximation of the nonfiltered field by truncated series expansion of the inverse filter operator. A posteriori tests for decaying compressible isotropic turbulence show excellent agreement with direct numerical simulation. The computational overhead of ADM is similar to that of a scale-similarity model and considerably less than for dynamic models.},

@article{Argyropoulos2015,
abstract = {This paper reviews the problems and successes of computing turbulent flow. Most of the flow phenomena that are important to modern technology involve turbulence. The review is concerned with methods for turbulent flow computer predictions and their applications, and describes several of them. These computational methods are aimed at simulating either as much detail of the turbulent motion as possible by current computer power or, more commonly, its overall effect on the mean-flow behaviour. The methods are still being developed and some of the most recent concepts involved are discussed. Some success has been achieved with two-equation models for relatively simple hydrodynamic phenomena; indeed, routine design work has been undertaken during the last three decades in several applications of engineering practise, for which extensive studies have optimised these models. Failures are still common for many applications particularly those that involve strong curvature, intermittency, strong buoyancy influences, low-Reynolds-number effects, rapid compression or expansion, strong swirl, and kinetically-influenced chemical reaction. New conceptual developments are needed in these areas, probably along the lines of actually calculating the principal manifestation of turbulence, e.g. intermittency. A start has been made in this direction in the form of 'multi-fluid' models, and full simulations. The turbulence modelling approaches presented here are, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), two-fluid models, Very Large Eddy Simulation (VLES), Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS), Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and some interesting, relatively recent, hybrid LES/RANS techniques. A large number of relatively recent studies are considered, together with reference to the numerical experiments existing on the subject. The authors hope that they provide the interested reader with most of the appropriate sources of turbulence modelling, exhibiting either as much detail as it is possible, by means of bibliography, or illustrating some of the most recent developments on the numerical modelling of turbulent flows. Thus, the potential user has the appropriate information, for him to select the suitable turbulence model for his own case of interest.},

@article{Zhiyin2015,
abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) was originally proposed for simulating atmospheric flows in the 1960s and has become one of the most promising and successful methodology for simulating turbulent flows with the improvement of computing power. It is now feasible to simulate complex engineering flows using LES. However, apart from the computing power, significant challenges still remain for LES to reach a level of maturity that brings this approach to the mainstream of engineering and industrial computations. This paper will describe briefly LES formalism first, present a quick glance at its history, review its current state focusing mainly on its applications in transitional flows and gas turbine combustor flows, discuss some major modelling and numerical challenges/issues that we are facing now and in the near future, and finish with the concluding remarks.},

@article{Pruett2008,
abstract = {Abstract  Large-eddy simulation (LES) has relied almost exclusively on spatial filtering to separate resolved and unresolved scales. For many reasons, temporal filtering may be more natural, particularly for flows of engineering interest. The paper develops the theory of temporal LES (TLES) and provides a demonstration of the concept by simulations of viscous Burger's flow and incompressible plane-channel flow. The latter is accomplished by adapting the approximate deconvolution model (ADM) of Stolz and Adams (Phys. Fluids 11:1699, 1999) to causal, time-domain filtering. The temporal variant of the ADM is termed the TADM.},
